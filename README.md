# hello-world
This is my first repository.

I hold a B.Eng in Mechanical Engineering from University of Uyo, Nigeria; I am a Robotics and Mechatronics anthusiast and an eCommerce entrepreneur. Presently I am taking coding lessons and I put my skills into practice by building pro bono projects for nonprofits.
