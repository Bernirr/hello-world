# hello-world
This is my first repository.

I am a Mechanical Engineer, a Robotics and Mechatronics anthusiast, and an eCommerce entrepreneur. I am currently learning to communicate with computers by taking coding lessons and I put my skills into practice by building pro bono projects for nonprofits.
